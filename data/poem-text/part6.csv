stanza	start-time	mood
"'But tell me, tell me! speak again,
Thy soft response renewing&#8212
What makes that ship drive on so fast?
What is the ocean doing?'"	0	
"'Still as a slave before his lord,
The ocean hath no blast;
His great bright eye most silently
Upon the Moon is cast&#8212"	9	
"'If he may know which way to go;
For she guides him smooth or grim.
See, brother, see! how graciously
She looketh down on him.'"	16.3	
"'But why drives on that ship so fast,
Without the wave or wind?'"	24	
"'The air is cut away before,
And closes from behind."	28	
"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!
Or we shall be belated:
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated.'"	31.1	
"I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
The dead men stood together."	40	
"All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter."	48.9	
"The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray."	57.8	
"And now this spell was snapt: once more
I viewed the ocean green,
And looked far forth, yet little saw
Of what had else been seen&#8212"	70	
"Like one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread."	78	
"But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade."	90.4	
"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring&#8212
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming."	97	
"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze&#8212
On me alone it blew."	104.2	
"Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
The light-house top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
Is this mine own countree?"	111.2	
"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray&#8212
O let me be awake, my God!
Or let me sleep always."	118.3	
"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly was it strewn!
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the Moon."	126.2	
"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,
That stands above the rock:
The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock."	133.7	
"And the bay was white with silent light,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were."	140.5	
"I turned my eyes upon the deck&#8212
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!"	146.45	
"Each corpse lay flat, lifeless and flat,
And, by the holy rood!
A man all light, an angel-man,
On every corse there stood."	149.7	
"This angel-band, each waved his hand:
It was a heavenly sight!
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light;"	158.3	
"The angel-band, each waved his hand,
No voice did they impart&#8212
No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on my heart."	166	
"But soon I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the Pilot's cheer;
My head was turned by force away
And I saw a boat appear."	175.2	
"The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
The dead men could not blast."	182	
"I saw a third&#8212I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll save my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood."	189
