stanza	start-time	mood
"Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,
Beloved from pole to pole!
To Mary Queen the praise be given!
She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,
That slid into my soul. "	0	hopeful
"The empty buckets on the deck,
That had so long remained,
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
And when I awoke, it rained. "	14	hopeful
"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
My garments all were dank;
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,
And still my body drank. "	21	hopeful
"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:
I was so light&#8212almost
I thought that I had died in sleep,
And was a blessed ghost. "	28	hopeful
"And soon I heard a roaring wind:
It did not come anear;
But with its sound it shook the sails,
That were so thin and sere. "	34.3	hopeful
"The upper air burst into life!
And a hundred fire-flags sheen,
To and fro they were hurried about!
And to and fro, and in and out,
The wan stars danced between. "	41	hopeful
"And the coming wind did roar more loud,
And the sails did sigh like sedge,
And the rain poured down from one black cloud;
The Moon was at its edge. "	50	party
"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still
The Moon was at its side:
Like waters shot from some high crag,
The lightning fell with never a jag,
A river steep and wide. "	57.8	party
"The loud wind never reached the ship,
Yet now the ship moved on!
Beneath the lightning and the Moon
The dead men gave a groan. "	66.5	party
"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,
Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;
It had been strange, even in a dream,
To see those dead men rise. "	73.7	party
"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;
Yet never a breeze up-blew;
The mariners began work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do;
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools&#8212
We were a ghastly crew. "	82	party
"The body of my brother's son
Stood by me, knee to knee:
The body and I pulled at one rope,
But he said nought to me. "	92	party
"Twas not those souls that fled in pain,
Which to their corses came again,
But a troop of spirits blest: "	98	party
"For when it dawned&#8212they dropped their arms,
And clustered round the mast;
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,
And from their bodies passed. "	103	hopeful
"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the Sun;
Slowly the sounds came back again,
Now mixed, now one by one. "	110	hopeful
"Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
I heard the sky-lark sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are,
How they seemed to fill the sea and air
With their sweet caroling! "	117	hopeful
"And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;
And now it is an angel's song,
That makes the heavens be mute. "	125	hopeful
"It ceased; yet still the sails made on
A pleasant noise till noon,
A noise like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune. "	135	elated
"Till noon we quietly sailed on,
Yet never a breeze did breathe:
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,
Moved onward from beneath. "	144.5	elated
"Under the keel nine fathom deep,
From the land of mist and snow,
The spirit slid: and it was he
That made the ship to go.
The sails at noon left off their tune,
And the ship stood still also. "	152	elated
"The Sun, right up above the mast,
Had fixed her to the ocean:
But in a minute she 'gan stir,
With a short uneasy motion&#8212
Backwards and forwards half her length
With a short uneasy motion. "	161.8	elated
"Then like a pawing horse let go,
She made a sudden bound:
It flung the blood into my head,
And I fell down in a swound. "	171	elated
"How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life returned,
I heard and in my soul discerned
Two voices in the air. "	177.5	party
"'Is it he?' quoth one, 'Is this the man?
By him who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he laid full low
The harmless Albatross. "	185.5	party
"'The spirit who bideth by himself
In the land of mist and snow,
He loved the bird that loved the man
Who shot him with his bow.' "	193	party
"The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:
Quoth he, 'The man hath penance done,
And penance more will do.' "	199.5	party-ominous
