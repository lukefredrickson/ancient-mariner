    <h1>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</h1>
    <h3>Part I</h3>

        <p>
            It is an ancient Mariner,
            And he stoppeth one of three.
            'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
            Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
            And I am next of kin;
            The guests are met, the feast is set:
            May'st hear the merry din.'
        </p>
        <p>
            He holds him with his skinny hand,
            'There was a ship,' quoth he.
            'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'
            Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
