NOTE TO GRADER:
This website uses variable fonts: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/typography/variable-fonts/
landing.css, main.css, and poem.css all use the "font-variation-settings" property, which controls the attributes of a variable font.
(see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variation-settings for more details)
This setting is flagged as an error by the w3 CSS validator, as variable fonts are relatively new, and the validator hasn't been updated to recognize them.
